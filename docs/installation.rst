Installation
============

There are two ways to install *pymt* on your local machine:

* :doc:`Stable release<installation-stable>`
* :doc:`From source<installation-source>`

If you plan to use *pymt* to run and couple models,
installing a :doc:`stable release<installation-stable>`
is a good option.
However, if you intend to develop with *pymt*,
it's best to install it
:doc:`from source<installation-source>`.
